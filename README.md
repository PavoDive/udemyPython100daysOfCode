# udemyPython100daysOfCode
Repository of code for Udemy's Python course

This is my code for Angela Yu's Python course at Udemy.

There are independent folders for each day (so far, when I created this repo I had just finished day 12). Most of the code is in English, but there are some of the assignments that I solved in Spanish, so I could show them to my children (even when the prompts are in Spanish, the code and comments --if any-- are in English).

In some cases I copied Angela's final code, when I found it significantly different to mine. If that's the case, the files are named in a way that will be evident.

As there may be many files in each folder (not only assignments, but also code challenges), the names of the files are related to what the file is or does, instead of the traditional ```main.py```.
