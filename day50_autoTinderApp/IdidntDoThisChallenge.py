# I didn't do this challenge because of a number of reasons:

# 1. I find it ethically questionable to either like or dislike someone who elected to expose themselves on a matching app.
# 2. I find it ethically questionable to inflate tinder's numbers, and hence value, by completing this assignment.

# While I understand --and believe-- that there are important lessons to be learned from this challenge, I'm willing
# to accept a small delay and learn those skills and concepts by doing some other, less questionable assignments.
