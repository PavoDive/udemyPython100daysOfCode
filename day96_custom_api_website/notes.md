# Custom API Based Website

Build a custom website using an API that you find interesting.

Using what you have learnt about HTTP request and REST APIs, in today's project you will build a website that uses data from a public API.
For example, previously we create a rain alert app using a weather API. We also created an ISS tracker and looking into Bitcoin prices, all using a public API.

Today, you get to work on an API that you find interesting and build a service or website based on that API.

Here are some example APIs:

+ [New York Subway Data](http://nycpulse.herokuapp.com/api)
+ [Elephant Data](https://elephant-api.herokuapp.com/?ref=public-apis)
+ [Barcode Generator/Recognition](https://www.cloudmersive.com/barcode-api?ref=public-apis)
+ [Stock Market Data](https://marketstack.com/)
+ [Harry Potter Data](https://www.potterapi.com/?ref=public-apis)
+ [Art Data](https://developers.artsy.net/v2/)
+ [Dictionary API](https://owlbot.info/?ref=public-apis)
+ [ESPN Data](http://www.espn.com/apis/devcenter/io-docs.html?ref=public-apis)
+ [Food Facts API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/8470508/SVtN3Wzy)
+ [Brewery Data](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/?ref=public-apis)
+ [Spelling and Grammar Check API](https://www.perfecttense.com/api)
+ [Sound Effects API](https://freesound.org/docs/api/index.html?ref=public-apis)
+ [Lord of the Rings API](https://the-one-api.dev/)

# Reflection Time:

This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.

Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

## General Approach

+ Use a universities API
+ Make a class for the actual interaction with the API
+ Instantiate that class from within Flask
+ Return the output to the user

## Implementation Details

+ I had clear what to do and how to do it.
+ I still get bogged down in the details of flask and or Jinja, particularily Jinja.
