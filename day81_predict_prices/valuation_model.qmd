# Setup and Context
 
### Introduction

Welcome to Boston Massachusetts in the 1970s! Imagine you\'re working for a real estate development company. Your company wants to value any residential project before they start. You are tasked with building a model that can provide a price estimate based on a home\'s characteristics like:

* The number of rooms
* The distance to employment centres
* How rich or poor the area is
* How many students there are per teacher in local schools etc

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/WfUSSP7.png height=350>

To accomplish your task you will:

1. Analyse and explore the Boston house price data
2. Split your data for training and testing
3. Run a Multivariable Regression
4. Evaluate how your model\'s coefficients and residuals
5. Use data transformation to improve your model performance
6. Use your model to estimate a property price

This is a copy of [UCI ML housing dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/housing/). This dataset was taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University. You can find the [original research paper here](https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/22636/0000186.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y).

# Preliminary Data Exploration ðŸ”Ž

**Challenge**

* What is the shape of `data`?
* How many rows and columns does it have?
* What are the column names?
* Are there any NaN values or duplicates?

```{python}
data.shape
data.columns
data.isna().sum()
data.duplicated().sum()
```

## Descriptive Statistics

**Challenge**

* How many students are there per teacher on average?

```{python}
print(f'The average pupil-to-teacher ratio in the data is {data["PTRATIO"].mean():.2f}.')
```

* What is the average price of a home in the dataset?

```{python}
print(f'The average price of a home in the dataset is ${1000 * data["PRICE" ].mean():,.2f}.')
```

* What is the `CHAS` feature?

```{python}
print(f'It is a variable indicating whether a property is next to the Carles River or not. In the dataset {100 * data[data["CHAS"] == 1].shape[0] / data.shape[0]:.2}% of the properties were next to the Charles river.')
```

* What is the maximum and the minimum number of rooms per dwelling in the dataset?

```{python}
print(f'The minumum number of rooms is {data["RM"].min():.1f}.')
print(f'The maximum number of rooms is {data["RM"].max():.1f}.')
```

## Visualise the Features

**Challenge**: Having looked at some descriptive statistics, visualise the data for your model. Use [Seaborn .displot()](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.displot.html) to create a bar chart and superimpose the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) for the following variables:

* PRICE: The home price in thousands.

```{python}
sns.displot(data, x = "PRICE")
plt.show()
```

* RM: the average number of rooms per owner unit.

```{python}
sns.displot(data, x = "RM")
plt.show()
```

* DIS: the weighted distance to the 5 Boston employment centres i.e., the estimated length of the commute.

```{python}
sns.displot(data, x = "DIS")
plt.show()
```

* RAD: the index of accessibility to highways.

```{python}
sns.displot(data, x = "RAD")
plt.show()
```

**Challenge**

Create a bar chart with plotly for CHAS to show many more homes are away from the river versus next to it. The bar chart should look something like this:

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/AHwoQ6l.png height=350>

You can make your life easier by providing a list of values for the x-axis (e.g., `x=['No', 'Yes']`)

```{python}
close_river = data.groupby("CHAS", as_index = False).size()
close_river["CHAS"] = close_river["CHAS"].astype(str)

fig = px.bar(close_river, x = "CHAS", y = "size", labels={"CHAS": "Close to the charles River?", "size": "Number of properties"})
fig.update_xaxes(type = "category", labelalias = {"0.0": "Not close", "1.0": "Close"})
fig.show()
```

# Understand the Relationships in the Data

## Run a Pair Plot

**Challenge**

There might be some relationships in the data that we should know about. Before you run the code, make some predictions:

* What would you expect the relationship to be between pollution (NOX) and the distance to employment (DIS)?
* What kind of relationship do you expect between the number of rooms (RM) and the home value (PRICE)?
* What about the amount of poverty in an area (LSTAT) and home prices?

Run a [Seaborn .pairplot()](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html?highlight=pairplot) to visualise all the relationships at the same time. Note, this is a big task and can take 1-2 minutes! After it\'s finished check your intuition regarding the questions above on the `pairplot`.

```{python}
sns.pairplot(data)
plt.show()
```

**Challenge**

Use [Seaborn\'s `.jointplot()`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.jointplot.html) to look at some of the relationships in more detail. Create a jointplot for:

* DIS and NOX

```{python}
sns.jointplot(data, x = "DIS", y = "NOX", alpha = .3)
plt.show()
```

* INDUS vs NOX

```{python}
sns.jointplot(data, x= "INDUS", y = "NOX", alpha = .3)
plt.show()
```

* LSTAT vs RM

```{python}
sns.jointplot(data, x = "LSTAT", y = "RM", alpha = .3)
plt.show()
```

* LSTAT vs PRICE

```{python}
sns.jointplot(data, x = "LSTAT", y = "PRICE", alpha = .3)
plt.show()
```

* RM vs PRICE

```{python}
sns.jointplot(data, x = "RM", y = "PRICE", alpha = .3)
plt.show()
```

Try adding some opacity or `alpha` to the scatter plots using keyword arguments under `joint_kws`.

# Split Training & Test Dataset

We *can\'t* use all 506 entries in our dataset to train our model. The reason is that we want to evaluate our model on data that it hasn\'t seen yet (i.e., out-of-sample data). That way we can get a better idea of its performance in the real world.

**Challenge**

* Import the [`train_test_split()` function](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split.html) from sklearn

```{python}
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

* Create 4 subsets: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test
* Split the training and testing data roughly 80/20.
* To get the same random split every time you run your notebook use `random_state=10`. This helps us get the same results every time and avoid confusion while we\'re learning.

Hint: Remember, your **target** is your home PRICE, and your **features** are all the other columns you\'ll use to predict the price.

```{python}
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.drop(columns = ["PRICE"]), data["PRICE"], test_size = .2, random_state = 10)
```

# Multivariable Regression

In a previous lesson, we had a linear model with only a single feature (our movie budgets). This time we have a total of 13 features. Therefore, our Linear Regression model will have the following form:

$$ PRICE = \theta_0 + \theta_1 RM + \theta_2 NOX + \theta_3 DIS + \theta_4 CHAS + \ldots + \theta_{13} LSTAT$$

## Run Your First Regression

**Challenge**

Use sklearn to run the regression on the training dataset. How high is the r-squared for the regression on the training data?

```{python}
reg = LinearRegression().fit(X_train, y_train)
```

## Evaluate the Coefficients of the Model

Here we do a sense check on our regression coefficients. The first thing to look for is if the coefficients have the expected sign (positive or negative).

**Challenge** Print out the coefficients (the thetas in the equation above) for the features. Hint: You\'ll see a nice table if you stick the coefficients in a DataFrame.

```{python}
coefficients_train = pd.DataFrame(zip(X_train.columns, reg.coef_))
coefficients_train.columns = ["Feature", "Coefficient"]
display(Markdown(coefficients_train.to_markdown()))
```

* We already saw that RM on its own had a positive relation to PRICE based on the scatter plot. Is RM\'s coefficient also positive?

```{python}
coef_rm = coefficients_train[coefficients_train['Feature'] == 'RM']['Coefficient'].iloc[0]
print(f"The coefficient of the number of rooms in the regression is {coef_rm:.2f}, which is {np.where(coef_rm < 0, 'negative', 'positive')}, and thus aligned with the expectation.")
```

* What is the sign on the LSAT coefficient? Does it match your intuition and the scatter plot above?

```{python}
coef_lstat = coefficients_train[coefficients_train['Feature'] == 'LSTAT']['Coefficient'].iloc[0]
print(f"The coefficient of the percentage of lower status to the total population in the regression is {coef_lstat:.2f}, which is {np.where(coef_lstat < 0, 'negative', 'positive')}, and thus aligned with the expectation.")
```

* Based on the coefficients, how much more expensive is a room with 6 rooms compared to a room with 5 rooms? According to the model, what is the premium you would have to pay for an extra room?

```{python}
print(f"For each extra room, a property is ${1000 * coef_rm:,.2f} more expensive, all other factors kept constant.")
```

## Analyse the Estimated Values & Regression Residuals

The next step is to evaluate our regression. How good our regression is depends not only on the r-squared. It also depends on the **residuals** - the difference between the model\'s predictions ($\hat{y_i}$) and the true values ($y_i$) inside `y_train`.


```{python}
predicted_values = reg.predict(X_train)
residuals = (y_train - predicted_values)
```

**Challenge**: Create two scatter plots.

The first plot should be actual values (`y_train`) against the predicted value values:

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/YMttBNV.png height=350>

```{python}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(y_train, predicted_values, color = "blue", alpha = .3)
ax.axline((0, 0), slope = 1, color = "cyan")
ax.set_ylabel("Predicted values")
ax.set_xlabel("Actual prices (training set)")
plt.show()
```

The cyan line in the middle shows `y_train` against `y_train`. If the predictions had been 100% accurate then all the dots would be on this line. The further away the dots are from the line, the worse the prediction was. That makes the distance to the cyan line, you guessed it, our residuals ðŸ˜Š

The second plot should be the residuals against the predicted prices. Here\'s what we\'re looking for:

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/HphsBsj.png height=350>

```{python}
f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(predicted_values, residuals, color = "purple", alpha = .3)
ax.set_xlabel("Predicted values")
ax.set_ylabel("Residuals")
plt.show()
```

Why do we want to look at the residuals? We want to check that they look random. Why? The residuals represent the errors of our model. If there\'s a pattern in our errors, then our model has a systematic bias.

We can analyse the distribution of the residuals. In particular, we\'re interested in the **skew** and the **mean**.

In an ideal case, what we want is something close to a normal distribution. A normal distribution has a skewness of 0 and a mean of 0. A skew of 0 means that the distribution is symmetrical - the bell curve is not lopsided or biased to one side. Here\'s what a normal distribution looks like:

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/7QBqDtO.png height=400>

**Challenge**

* Calculate the mean and the skewness of the residuals.

```{python}
from scipy.stats import skew

print(f"The mean of the residuals is {residuals.mean():.2f}, and the skewness is {skew(residuals):.2f}")
```

* Again, use Seaborn\'s `.displot()` to create a histogram and superimpose the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE)
* Is the skewness different from zero? If so, by how much?
* Is the mean different from zero?

```{python}
sns.displot(residuals.to_frame(), x = "PRICE")
plt.show()
```

## Data Transformations for a Better Fit

We have two options at this point:

1. Change our model entirely. Perhaps a linear model is not appropriate.
2. Transform our data to make it fit better with our linear model.

Let\'s try a data transformation approach.

**Challenge**

Investigate if the target `data['PRICE']` could be a suitable candidate for a log transformation.

* Use Seaborn\'s `.displot()` to show a histogram and KDE of the price data.
* Calculate the skew of that distribution.

```{python}
sns.displot(data, x = "PRICE")
plt.show()

print(f"The skewness of the Price original data is {skew(data['PRICE']):.2f}.")
```

* Use [NumPy\'s `log()` function](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.log.html) to create a Series that has the log prices
* Plot the log prices using Seaborn\'s `.displot()` and calculate the skew.
* Which distribution has a skew that\'s closer to zero?

```{python}
data["log_price"] = np.log(data["PRICE"])
sns.displot(data, x = "log_price")
plt.show()
print(f"The skewness of the log-transformed price is {skew(data['log_price']):.2f}.")
```

### How does the log transformation work?

Using a log transformation does not affect every price equally. Large prices are affected more than smaller prices in the dataset. Here\'s how the prices are \"compressed\" by the log transformation:

<img src=https://i.imgur.com/TH8sK1Q.png height=200>

We can see this when we plot the actual prices against the (transformed) log prices.

```{python}
f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(data["PRICE"], data["log_price"], alpha = .3)
ax.set_ylabel("Log-transformed price")
ax.set_xlabel("Price")
plt.show()
```

## Regression using Log Prices

Using log prices instead, our model has changed to:

$$ \log{PRICE} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 RM + \theta_2 NOX + \theta_3 DIS + \theta_4 CHAS + \ldots + \theta_{13} LSTAT $$

**Challenge**:

* Use `train_test_split()` with the same random state as before to make the results comparable.
* Run a second regression, but this time use the transformed target data.

```{python}
X_log_train, X_log_test, y_log_train, y_log_test = train_test_split(data.drop(columns = ["PRICE", "log_price"]), data["log_price"], test_size = .2, random_state = 10)
reg_log = LinearRegression().fit(X_log_train, y_log_train)
```

* What is the r-squared of the regression on the training data?
* Have we improved the fit of our model compared to before based on this measure?

## Evaluating Coefficients with Log Prices

**Challenge**: Print out the coefficients of the new regression model.

```{python}
coefficients_log_train = pd.DataFrame(zip(X_log_train.columns, reg_log.coef_))
coefficients_log_train.columns = ["Feature", "Coefficient"]
display(Markdown(coefficients_log_train.to_markdown()))
```

* Do the coefficients still have the expected sign?
* Is being next to the river a positive based on the data?
* How does the quality of the schools affect property prices? What happens to prices as there are more students per teacher?

Hint: Use a DataFrame to make the output look pretty.

## Regression with Log Prices & Residual Plots

**Challenge**:

* Copy-paste the cell where you\'ve created scatter plots of the actual versus the predicted home prices as well as the residuals versus the predicted values.
* Add 2 more plots to the cell so that you can compare the regression outcomes with the log prices side by side.
* Use `indigo` as the colour for the original regression and `navy` for the color using log prices.

```{python}
predicted_log_values = reg_log.predict(X_log_train)
residuals_log = (y_log_train - predicted_log_values)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(y_log_train, predicted_log_values, color = "blue", alpha = .3)
ax.axline((1.5, 1.5), slope = 1, color = "cyan")
ax.set_ylabel("Predicted log values")
ax.set_xlabel("Actual log prices (training set)")
plt.show()

f, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(predicted_log_values, residuals_log, color = "purple", alpha = .3)
ax.set_xlabel("Predicted log values")
ax.set_ylabel("Residuals (log)")
plt.show()

print(f"The mean of the residuals_log is {residuals_log.mean():.2f}, and the skewness is {skew(residuals_log):.2f}")
sns.displot(residuals_log.to_frame(), x = "log_price")
plt.show()
```

**Challenge**:

Calculate the mean and the skew for the residuals using log prices. Are the mean and skew closer to 0 for the regression using log prices?

# Compare Out of Sample Performance

The *real* test is how our model performs on data that it has not \"seen\" yet. This is where our `X_test` comes in.

**Challenge**

Compare the r-squared of the two models on the test dataset. Which model does better? Is the r-squared higher or lower than for the training dataset? Why?

```{python}
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

predicted_test_normal = reg.predict(X_test)
predicted_test_log = reg_log.predict(X_log_test)

r2_training_normal = r2_score(y_train, predicted_values)
r2_training_log = r2_score(y_log_train, predicted_log_values)
r2_test_normal = r2_score(y_test, predicted_test_normal)
r2_test_log = r2_score(y_log_test, predicted_test_log)

df_r2 = pd.DataFrame({"Type": ["Training set, normal", "Training set, log", "Test set, normal", "Test set, log"], "R2": [r2_training_normal, r2_training_log, r2_test_normal, r2_test_log]})

display(Markdown(df_r2.to_markdown(index = False)))
```

# Predict a Property\'s Value using the Regression Coefficients

Our preferred model now has an equation that looks like this:

$$ \log{PRICE} = \theta_0 + \theta_1 RM + \theta_2 NOX + \theta_3 DIS + \theta_4 CHAS + ... + \theta_{13} LSTAT $$

The average property has the mean value for all its charactistics:


## Starting Point: Average Values in the Dataset

```{python}
features = data.drop(['PRICE', "log_price"], axis=1)
average_vals = features.mean().values
property_stats = pd.DataFrame(data=average_vals.reshape(1, len(features.columns)),
                              columns=features.columns)
display(Markdown(property_stats.T.to_markdown()))
```

**Challenge**

Predict how much the average property is worth using the stats above. What is the log price estimate and what is the dollar estimate? You\'ll have to [reverse the log transformation with `.exp()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html?highlight=exp) to find the dollar value.

**Challenge**

Keeping the average values for CRIM, RAD, INDUS and others, value a property with the following characteristics:

# Define Property Characteristics

+ next_to_river = True
+ nr_rooms = 8
+ students_per_classroom = 20
+ distance_to_town = 5
+ pollution = data.NOX.quantile(q=0.75) # high
+ amount_of_poverty =  data.LSTAT.quantile(q=0.25) # low

```{python}
x_particular = property_stats.copy()
x_particular["CHAS"] = 1
x_particular["RM"] = 8
x_particular["PTRATIO"] = 20
x_particular["DIS"] = 5
x_particular["NOX"] = data["NOX"].quantile(.75) # high
x_particular["LSTAT"] = data["LSTAT"].quantile(.25) # low

y_particular = reg_log.predict(x_particular)

print(f"The property has a predicted value of ${np.exp(y_particular)[0] * 1000:,.2f}.")
```
