# Web scrapper

Using what you have learnt about web scraping, scrape a website for data that you are interested in. Try to build a CSV with the scraped data.
What you scrape is up to you. 


Here are some suggestions:

+ [NBA&nbsp;Player Stats](https://www.nba.com/stats/)
+ [Audible Books and Ratings](https://www.audible.com/search?keywords=book&amp;node=18573211011)
+ [Miami House Foreclosure Listing](https://miamidade.realforeclose.com/index.cfm?zaction=AUCTION&amp;Zmethod=PREVIEW&amp;AUCTIONDATE=11/02/2020)

# Reflection time

This is a place to journal your experience of completing this project. This will help you figure out how to improve as a developer.

Write down how you approached the project. What was hard, what was easy. How might you improve for the next project? What was your biggest learning from today? What would you do differently if you were to tackle this project again?

## General Approach

+ I'll jump this one, as I don't find anything really interesting to scrape.
